Failed commands often generate unwanted or irrelevant error messages
That output can be saved as a log, sent to whoever should see it, or discarded
Logs are usually kept in /var for programs we care about managing
Redirect output using >&, >>&, |&, or #>, or #>&#

grapsnag >& /tmp/errormessage.txt
if [ $? != 0 ]; then
	logger -t $(basename "$0") -i -p user.warning -f /tmp/errormessage.txt && rm /tmp/errormessage.txt
