#Prompt the user to provide a count from 1 to 5 which will be your number of dice, defaulting to 2 dice if the user just presses enter.
# Prompt the user for how many sides the dice should have (assume they all have the same number of sides). The number of sides must be from 4 to 20,
# with 6 being the default if the user just presses enter.
# Roll your virtual dice, and display what number came up on each,
#along with the sum of the rolls. Be sure to include the defaults in your prompts to the user. Name this script rolldice.sh.
